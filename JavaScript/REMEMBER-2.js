// join :- the join() method lets you take an array and combine its elements into one string.

// pop :- the pop method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller.

// push :- the push method adds elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.


// shift :- the shift method removes the first elements of an array and returns that value to the caller.
// The shift() method changes the original array.

// unshift :- the unshift method adds new elements to the beginning of an array  and returns the new length of the array.
// The unshift() method overwrites the original array.


///////// 18 //////
// concat :- the concat method allows you to merge multiple arrays at once.  

// Sort :- the Sort method compares the elements of the array by converting them into strings and then comparing their Unicode code points.
// compare :- When the sort() function compares two values, it sends the values to the compare function, and sorts the values according to the returned (negative, zero, positive) value.
//  If the result is negative, a is sorted before b . If the result is positive, b is sorted before a .

// reverse :-the reverse method reverses the order of the elements in an array. 

// splice :-the splice method is used to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and adding new elements.
//  splice method modifies the original array and returns an array of the removed elements.

//  slice :-the slice method returns selected elements in an array, as a new array.



// //////// 19 // /////
// forEach :- The forEach method allows you to iterate over an array and per'form an operation on each element of the array.

////////////20/////////////
// map method :- The map method creates a new array by calling a function on every element of the original array and storing the results in a new array.
// map() returns the new array, and the original array is unchanged.


// Filter method :- The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
// The filter() method does not execute the function for empty elements
// The filter() method does not change the original array.

// reduce method :-The "reduce()" method is used to reduce an array to a single value by applying a function to each element.
