//cookies:- JavaScript cookies are small data stored on a user's device by a web browser. 

// encodeURIComponent :- The encodeURIComponent() method encodes special characters including: , / ? : @ & = + $ #

// decodeURIComponent :- It decodes all escape sequences, including those that are not created by encodeURIComponent , like -.! ~*'() .

// localStorage :- localStorage in JavaScript allows web applications to store data locally within the user's browser â€“ with no expiration date. The data isn't deleted when the browser is closed, and is available when the browser is opened again.

// key :- To store data in local storage, you use the setItem() method. This method takes in two arguments, a key and a value. If the key does not exist in local storage, the setItem() method will create a new key and assign the given value to it.

// setItem() : Adds key and value to localStorage. 

// getItem() : Retrieves/gets items from localStorage.

//  removeItem() : Removes an item from localStorage. 

// clear() : Clears all data from localStorage.

//  key() : Passes a number to retrieve the key of a localStorage.


// sessionStorage :- sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends

// setItem(key, value): It sets the data in the sessionStorage with the passed key and value. 

// getItem(key): This method will return the value of the key passed to it, if it is stored in the storage.

// removeItem(key): It will remove the passed key with its value from the storage.
