// Synscronaus programing :- As the name suggests synchronous means to be in a sequence, i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one. So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement to get executed

// asynchronous programing :- One approach to asynchronous programming is to make functions that need to wait for something take an extra argument, a callback function. The asynchronous function starts a process, sets things up so that the callback function is called when the process finishes, and then returns.

//callback :- A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.
// Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.

// loadScript :- dynamically load as many JavaScript files as necessary on a page, but make sure you consider the order in which files must be loaded.

// Promises :- JavaScript Promises used to simplify managing multiple asynchronous operations, preventing callback hell and unmanageable code.

// then :- The then() method provides two callbacks: One funtion to run when a promise is fulfilled and one funtion to run when a promise is rejected.

// catch :- The catch() method of Promise instances schedules a function to be called when the promise is rejected

// Async and Await :- Async and Await in JavaScript are powerful keywords used to handle asynchronous operations with promises.

// async :- The async function allows us to write promise-based code as if it were synchronous.

// async :- Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Once that task has finished, your program is presented with the result.

// try catch :- it is used to handle the error-prone part of the code.

// finally :- The finally() method is used to return a Promise, when a promise is settled, Like then() and catch(), that is either fulfilled or rejected.
